This plugin tries to improve the existing behaviour of the |f|, |F|, |t| and
|T| command by letting them move the cursor not only inside the current line, but move to whatever line, where the character is found.

It does consider counts given and should work simply as a user would be expecting.

It basically does that, by remapping the f,F,t and T command to issue a search for the character that is entered and moving the cursor there.

By default the new f,F,t,T commands should simply work. If you have disabled
the plugin (see |improvedft-Disable|), use the command
    :EnableImprovedFT

If for any reason, you want to disable the plugin, use
    :DisableImprovedFT
